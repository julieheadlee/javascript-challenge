Create a simple website that reveal UFO data based upon date given in a form on the webpage.  While I attempted to create the bonus form that filtered based on multiple criteria, I was not successful in finishing that project.  This webpage: 

1. Upon first load displays all data found in the data.js file with no filters applied.
2. Once a date is entered in the box and the button is pushed, the data table displays only data meeting that requirement.
3. Once the date is removed from the date input field in the form, the entire data table is once again displayed.
